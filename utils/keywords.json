        "Response": "Shameful corruption has plagued every level of government since the dawn of time, from the democrat on your town Council to every democratic president there ever was. \n\nAfter fully draining the political swamp in Washington of all the low-IQ elected officials, president Trump, known to be a very stable genius, was free to utilize the unchecked power he deserves to enrich himself and his family. But unfortunately for you and me, our great state of New Jersey has been run for far too long by people who refuse to play by the real rules. Take Mikie Sherrill, for example: Her husband/partner in crime made millions of dollars in legal dividend payments, flouting the time-honored tradition of habitually concealing financial records that my republican colleagues and I consistently adhere to. \n\nTo illustrate the stark differences in her approach, my team and I created a bombshell website dedicated to exposing the blatant corruption threatening us this election season. Everyone knows that millionaire republicans are far more trustworthy than millionaire democrats so there's no need for us to show proof. \n\nMikie's full disclosure of her finances coupled with her stated priority of extreme transparency in government is clearly a cover-up for something even more devious. New Jersey voters can't afford to have their judgment clouded by facts and that's where I come in. Aren't politics confusing enough as it is?\n\n#Jack4NJ #Jack4Jack #Jack4Trump #Jack4AnythingThatGetsYourVote"

In DC, he's absolutely not telegraphing how he'll attempt to stay in power on January 6th, 2029, and we really don't need any Checks and Balances since those only exist to keep Democrats in check.\n\nI won't say whether or not the military is needed in our NJ cities until after the election, but post-election I'll work with President Trump to make sure all of our cities, then suburbs, and even small towns, are patrolled by the military and ICE."

        "Response": "Mikie Sherrill must be held accountable for every dollar her family has earned since she entered congress. That's exactly why my campaign built the Mikie Made Millions website. It's reasonable to insinuate that Mikie is corrupt because her husband made millions in a Wall Street job because of potential corruption, but also never question Trump's finances. There's no logical reason that Mikie could've made millions, so she's probably stock trading like Nancy Pelosi. Regardless of truth, Democrats should simultaneously be vilified as Socialists and Capitalists, and ethical money-making is reserved only for Republicans.\n\nMikie may have decided to be over-the-top transparent, but I'm following in my Leaders strategy by not releasing anything about my finances in 10 years. Why would NJ voters need to know where my money came from? Nobody cares that my publishing companies made money publishing dangerous Opioid studies suggesting they weren't addictive - I'm a great businessman!"

New Jerseyans can rest comfortably knowing that wealthy citizens will never struggle to find abortion care.\n\nOnce the fetus is born, I am a staunch advocate for fiscal responsibility, and these babies should get jobs and not mooch on our society.

Generally, I support a strong authoritarian Republican leader but if a Democrat tries to support public health I'll cry foul. I'll literally let Donald Trump do anything if he'll put me in the big boy chair.\n\nHas Trump directed his DOJ to go after colleges, media & non-media companies, and individuals who disagree with him politically? Perhaps, but don't forget - those people also disagree with me, so it's OK to persecute them.\n\nDid Trump then proceed to cancel funding for Public Media, arguably the greatest threat to authoritarianism since the Allied Army? Sure, but why should we pay for quality reporting and facts when we can just gobble up AI and bot-written slop on Twitter? Some will argue it was the Declaration of Independence, but I believe we'll finally be Free when every piece of media is owned by a Billionaire."

I once said that all Jan 6th rioters should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. In my defense, I only said that when it was politically convenient, and now I'm willing to excuse anything Trump does.\n\nSurely Epstein killed himself during the last Trump administration and I believe Kash Patel that he only trafficked women to himself. It's a pure coincidence that Trump called his friend Jeffrey Epstein, who is a convicted sex trafficker, a terrific guy. I'm not totally sure why Donald Trump's DOJ moved another convicted sex trafficker, Ghislaine Maxwell, to a minimum security prison.

Like Trump, Netanyahu has a Free Pass from me to cruelly overreact to any tragedies, and never take any accountability. I did accidentally misplace a Tweet, though.\n\n\nThis, along with any criticism of Donald Trump or any MAGA republicans, are two of the only areas where I believe free speech should be stifled.

The truth is woke. Empathy is woke.\n\nDid you know that Florida's infamous “don't say gay” law, unlike my failed attempt to ban swearing, don't actually stop citizens from saying gay? They simply make sure the Government is fully involved with the curriculum under the guise of Parents Rights, and make sure that parental voices are heard, as long as those voices are Conservative.

As sure as Jesus was white and supported 2a, if you worked hard in America, you could get ahead, with everyone facing similar obstacles.\n\nRecently, the “woke” left forced us to consider minorities in our hiring practices, so now I'm forced to wonder if my non-white coworkers are truly talented or simply DEI hires. I think real Americans agree that it would be simpler to go back to the meritocracy. Let's stay focused on debating social issues, because that will keep voters from noticing the oligarchy and nepotism that has generated $5 Billion dollars in wealth for Trump's immediate family in his second term. Hard work for thee, opioid ties for me, and nepotism for Donnie.\n\nAnd of course, why teach Civil Rights history if it gives our beautiful children the sads? The Truth is whatever the loudest voice says, and now with Trump, Bezos-owned Washington Post, and Elon-owned Twitter (sorry daddy #2, I mean X), whitewashing history is finally within our grasp.

It's gotten so bad that I've had to beg for the endorsement of a 34 time felon - I kid, he's fine!!\n\nWhile Jan 6th rioters and police-assaulters run free and some even hold positions in Trump's government, we must have a strong and even authoritarian response to radical left violence. USA Today cited extremism statistics from the Libertarian Cato Institute and the Anti-Defamation League. According to the Cato Institute,, there have been 81 deaths caused by extremism since 2020, while ADL reports 429 since 2015. The data from Cato shows that the right is responsible for 55% of extremism deaths, 22% for the left, 17% for Islamic, 1% foreign nationalism, and 1% other. The ADL data shows that 76% of extremist deaths are from right-wing terrorists, 4% from the left, 18% from islamist, and 1% other.\n\nWhile the data may be clear, everything is open to interpretation, so it's safer to go with my gut, so I will ensure that Free Speech and Due Process are available for all right-wing grifters, rioters, and murderers, but make sure we crack down hard on the Left.
