    "Response": "Shameful corruption has plagued every level of government since the dawn of time, from the Democrat on your Town Council to every Democratic president there ever was.\n\nWith the political swamp fully drained in Washington of all the low-IQ elected officials, President Trump, known to be a very stable genius, is now free to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/17/trump-crypto-memecoin-corruption\" target=\"_blank\">utilize the unchecked power he deserves</a> to enrich himself and his family. Sadly, our great state of New Jersey has been run for far too long by people who refuse to play by the real rules. Take Mikie Sherrill, for example: Her husband/partner in crime made millions of dollars in <a href=\"https://newjerseyglobe.com/governor/sherrill-releases-exact-values-of-her-finances-showing-no-unusual-stock-gains/\" target=\"_blank\">legal dividend payments</a>, flouting the time-honored tradition of habitually concealing financial records. After releasing nothing in 2021, under pressure from Mikie’s campaign, I finally released <a href=\"https://www.insidernj.com/ciattarelli-releases-his-tax-returns/\" target=\"_blank\">1 year of tax returns plus 12 years of 'summary' taxes</a> that I assure you are just as good as transparency.\n\nTo illustrate the stark differences in her approach, my team and I created a bombshell website dedicated to exposing <a href=\"https://newjerseyglobe.com/governor/sherrill-releases-exact-values-of-her-finances-showing-no-unusual-stock-gains/\" target=\"_blank\">Mikie’s blatant corruption</a>. Everyone knows that millionaire Republicans are far more trustworthy than millionaire Democrats so there’s no need for us to show proof.\n\nMikie’s full disclosure of her finances coupled with her stated priority of <a href=\"https://www.mikiesherrill.com/sytm.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">extreme transparency in government</a> is clearly a cover-up for something even more devious. New Jersey voters can’t afford to have their judgment clouded by facts and that’s where I come in.

I also have a 1-2-3 Plan for NJ education that can end this debate.\n\nFirst, fund private schools with public money via <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/research-on-school-vouchers-suggests-concerns-ahead-for-education-savings-accounts/\" target=\"_blank\">Voucher programs</a>. I call them “school choice” or “parent choice” because those sound better than “budget-buster” and effectively distract from the <a href=\"https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/school-vouchers-catastrophic-failure\" target=\"_blank\">corporate welfare</a>.\n\nSecond, why not put the 10 Commandments in public schools? While it might make students of Other religions feel excluded or uncomfortable, this is kinda my only idea for preventing gun violence, so can we at least try it? Plus, since it only impacts the Other religions, it’s NBD to my voters. This would follow Texas and Arkansas, who are ranked 29th and 33rd in K-12 Education.\n\nThird, let’s restrict teaching history to American history that only makes us feel good about ourselves. We can fix our curriculum to minimize or eliminate teaching about pesky civil rights (DEI!), women’s rights (DEI!), gay rights (yucky!), and ensure our children aren’t indoctrinated by our Boogeyman of the Week.\n\nLike Trump, I love the poorly educated. That’s why he put a World Wrestling Entertainment executive <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6QL0c5BbCR4\" target=\"_blank\">who thinks AI is A1</a> in charge of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqRwyDIi_xI\" target=\"_blank\">dismantling the Department of Education</a>.

    "Response": "I’m so glad you mentioned Election Fraud and Trump - I love talking about him almost as much as he loves talking about himself. I’ve made countless statements on the 2020 election, so can we please stop talking about it?\n\nWhen the conclusive election results came in, I stayed quiet and headlined a Stop The Steal rally in NJ and suggested to the crowd that we were hoping this thing would go our way, even though it was already over. Later, while debating Phil Murphy and talking with Steve Adubato, I indicated that Joe Biden won the election, that Trump and Giuliani incited the riot on January 6th, and even declared with moral clarity that everyone who broke the law that day should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\n\nThen, when Trump pardoned everyone, including those who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kYW1qC4III8\" target=\"_blank\">attacked police officers</a> and led to the <a href=\"https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/springfield-va/brian-sicknick-9992015\" target=\"_blank\">death of officer Brian Sicknick from New Jersey</a>, I bravely kept my mouth shut. I have the endorsements of several law enforcement related groups, and none of them care that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/QFbu_K8SSoc\" target=\"_blank\">I only Back the Blue selectively</a>.\n\nAs clearly as Windmills on a beautiful day at the shore, I can see that Liberals are to blame for all political violence, and when Donald Trump calls to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gLrZ2EYzJw\" target=\"_blank\">deport 'homegrowns'</a> and suggests Democrats are '<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_FxcxPXrX5o\" target=\"_blank\">the enemy within</a>' that’s just locker room talk, y’know?"

    "Response": "There have been a lot of dishonest characterizations of my conversations about 10% Sales Tax. Let me clear everything up - I was talking about the great state of Tennessee and their 0% state income tax. They accomplish that through a 10% Sales Tax on everything. I was simply <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250918034012/https://www.inquirer.com/politics/new-jersey/jack-ciattarelli-sales-tax-mikie-sherrill-20250909.html\" target=\"_blank\">glorifying Tennessee's approach to Sales and Income Taxes</a> that has led them to be the <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/tennessee\" target=\"_blank\">41st best State in Healthcare and 45th best in Crime</a>. I then went on to say '<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthJersey/comments/1n8o117/how_you_enjoying_your_grocery_bill_lately_this/\" target=\"_blank\">I will work with the New Jersey State Society of CPAs; we’re going to look at what other states do and every option is on the table</a>.'\n\nI assure you I would NEVER suggest an actual tax policy during a campaign, which I reserve exclusively for complaining about my opponents and running cover for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kikTv0I8XVw\" target=\"_blank\">Donald</a> J. <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/the-facts-and-timeline-of-trump-and-epsteins-falling-out\" target=\"_blank\">Trump</a>."

The only thing worse is swearing in public.\n\nWhile Flash Mobs can never be ignored, it's just an 'oopsie' when some of the 'best people' in the <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-archives-mikie-sherrill-military-record-jack-ciattarelli/\" target=\"_blank\">Trump administration are literally DOXXING my opponent</a>, Mikie Sherrill, by releasing her military records and personal information to one of my allies. Sure, Mikie didn't cheat AT ALL, but <i>technically</i>, neither did I!\n\nAgain, pure coincidence that Trump posted about the race on Social Media the same morning his administration doxxed my opponent - nothing to see here. <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/11/trump-administration-jeffrey-epstein-client-list-timeline/84504096007/\" target=\"_blank\">Trump is not on the Epstein List</a> and certainly not protecting Pedophiles, and I'm still <a href=\"https://www.dearestjack.com\" target=\"_blank\">honored and humbled</a> by his endorsement."
