        You spoke like someone who understood New Jersey - its grit, its talent,
        its heartbreak, its hope. You blamed Christie for the mess. You blamed
        Murphy for the missteps. And I believed you. Because you sounded honest.

        You say you're not MAGA, but you pledged loyalty to Trump for his
        endorsement. You stood silent while he praised the January 6th rioters.
        You didn't speak up when Capitol Police officers were pepper sprayed and
        beaten - including Brian Sicknick, a New Jerseyan who died defending
        democracy.

        under-resourced public classrooms. NJ needs help in certain areas, but
        did you notice that we're #1 in Education? Maybe don't ruin that. You
        talk about parental rights, but you won't protect a woman's right to
        choose. You said that you've
